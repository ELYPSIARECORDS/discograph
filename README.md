[Discograph](http://discograph.mbrsi.org/) - Social Graphing for the Discogs Database

#### What?

Disco/graph is an interactive visualization of the relationships between musicians, bands and labels. :notes:

All of Disco/graph's data is derived from the [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com) discography database: nearly 4 million artists, 1 million labels, and 7 million releases creating a network of nearly 70 million different relationships.

What do all of these symbols mean?

* Small circles represent artists.
* Large circles represent bands.
* Solid lines show band membership.
* Dotted lines show pseudonyms.

The graph only shows 100 entities at a time, so double-click on any circle containing a plus-sign to reveal more connections.
